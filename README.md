IMC prosperity - a space for algorithms to be created and shared in our team

## Tutorial Round:
Used weighted moving average for starfruit and set price of 10k for amethyst and just market took with arbs. Ended up with around ~2.4k pnl

## 8th April 7:00PM - Round 1:
Trading starfruit and amethyst again, website logs are half of tutorial round (max timestamp of 10k). Tutorial algorithm is uploaded but makes a lot less than expected -> switched to linear reg for starfruit price prediction. We realised we could market make as well so we implement a market making strategy that is tweaked hella until submission. By the end of day 2, we hit a roadblock of 3330 pnl. Day 3 progress is insignificant and we produce no better algorithm. However, Round 1 gets extended due to IMC server problems so we have another day. By the end of day for, we hit 3456 pnl - ~1.8k for starfruit and the rest on amethyst.
