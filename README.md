IMC prosperity - a space for algorithms to be created and shared in our team

## Tutorial Round:
Used weighted moving average for starfruit and set price of 10k for amethyst and just market took with arbs. Ended up with around ~2.4k pnl

## 8th April 7:00PM - Round 1:
Trading starfruit and amethyst again, website logs are half of tutorial round (max timestamp of 10k). Tutorial algorithm is uploaded but makes a lot less than expected -> switched to linear reg for starfruit price prediction. We realised we could market make as well so we implement a market making strategy that is tweaked hella until submission. By the end of day 2, we hit a roadblock of 3330 pnl. Day 3 progress is insignificant and we produce no better algorithm. However, Round 1 gets extended due to IMC server problems so we have another day. By the end of day for, we hit 3456 pnl - ~1.8k for starfruit and the rest on amethyst. 

# Results after round 1: 130k pnl, 360th global and 16th in AUS

## 12th April - Round 2:
Rough rough rough start. We struggled to find out how sunlight and humidity could be used for the first 2 and a half days of this round. Only in the last 20 minutes did we realise that all our profits could be made from market making, and totalling ignoring sunlight and humidity. We went from <2k to 78k within the last 40 minutes, and with some further tweaking, managed to hit 91k by 6:53 (7:00 PM round end). Manual trading was straight forward. 

# Results after round 2: 591k pnl, 166th global and 9th in AUS
